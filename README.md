# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive tool that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It dynamically displays the process of sorting arrays using algorithms like Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort, helping users understand their logic and performance visually.

Project Description:

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based application that visually represents how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. The project aims to help users understand the logic, efficiency, and behavior of sorting algorithms through animations rather than abstract code. Users can choose an algorithm, adjust the array size and speed, and watch how the algorithm sorts the data step-by-step.

This project bridges the gap between theory and practical understanding by showing how elements are compared, swapped, and positioned until the array is completely sorted.

Objectives:

To create a tool that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms.

To enhance understanding of algorithm efficiency and time complexity.

To allow interactive learning by letting users modify parameters.

To provide a comparative view of multiple sorting techniques.

Key Features:

Algorithm Selection:
Choose from multiple algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Real-Time Visualization:
Bars of different heights represent array elements. During sorting, color and position changes indicate comparisons and swaps.

Adjustable Parameters:
Users can modify array size, sorting speed, and restart visualizations instantly.

Performance Comparison:
Observe how algorithm efficiency changes with array size and structure.

User-Friendly Interface:
Clean, responsive design built for ease of understanding and engagement.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks/Libraries: React.js or Vanilla JS (optional for interactivity)

Algorithms Implemented: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort

Working Principle:

The program generates a random array of numbers represented as vertical bars.

When a sorting algorithm is selected, the visualization begins.

The bars are highlighted or swapped as per the algorithm’s logic.

Once sorting completes, all bars are displayed in sorted order with visual confirmation.

Expected Outcomes:

Enhanced conceptual understanding of sorting algorithms.

Interactive and engaging learning experience.

Ability to compare algorithm speed and performance visually.
